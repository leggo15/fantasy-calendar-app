World Overview: Decaying Birchworld Setting (A birchworld is a megastructure shell built to take advantage of a black holes gravity well for living space. Its built at a distance where the gravitational pull would equal earths or a desired pull. There can be thousands of layers at a few hundred km height at roughly this distance) The lower layers are disintegrating and forming into floating shard pieces or partial layers.

Setting Origin: The known world was once part of a colossal Birch World layer which was shattered by unknown means, leaving behind enormous shell fragments orbiting a central black hole.

World Structure: The known world exists on a single shard - a flat, massive piece of the old shell. The shard is stable in orbit around the black hole, underside facing inward. Light comes from captured stars orbiting approximately 1 AU from the birch world surface (each layer's roof functions as a display showing the sky above the birch world).

Gravity and Living Conditions: Gravity on the shard approximates Earth's gravity, engineered to match when the Birch World was intact. The upper surface is habitable; the underside faces the black hole directly and is unreachable by conventional means.

Expansion: Potential future expansions could involve shard collisions, merging habitable zones, and introducing new cultures or lands.


Magic System: Gravity-Based Magic

Magic Strength: Magic is directly tied to how warped time-space is. The deeper into the black hole's gravity well, the stronger magic becomes.


Magic Seasons:

There are 12 regular months, maintaining a traditional yearly cycle for agriculture, holidays, etc.

Magic strength follows a 3-season(each 71 months long) "gravitational cycle" that is offset and drifts relative to the 12-month calendar.

This gravitational cycle is tied to the black hole's spin dragging time-space around it creating folds of varying depth.

Pattern: If last year's fall was "low magic," this year's fall will likely be "mid magic," and the next years "high magic," before looping back around.

96 Strands: In addition to the magic seasons there are 96 shorter periods that heighten or weakens magic, and often specific types of magic. These last for only a week at the most and are not always in effect, with up to two months between them.

Example of a Date

October 25th Low fall, Fire Strand Of the year 1121. 
This would mean magic as a whole is pretty weak this season but fire based magic has an edge compared to everything else.


It is important to note about the view from within the world:
This is a fantasy late medieval setting, no one in this world has the faintest clue how gravity works, that piece of flavour is to make an underlying structure to things and not for the world or party to know. Same with the idea of a birch world and a back hole, for the residents of a shard that is the world and anything seen in the sky is mystical, and the edge is myth to some, fact to others but death to most that dare investigate due to the hard climate around the edge. The shard is for the most part stable and other shards very rarely cross the sky close enough to be disenable as anything other than a moving star.
